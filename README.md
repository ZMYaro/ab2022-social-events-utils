## Speed Friending Conversation Starter Cards

Navigate to `/conversation_starter_cards/index.html`, and you should just be able to hit print.  You do need to have the Museo Sans font installed (grab it from the Anime Boston Brand Assets folder if you do not).

Make sure you print with zero margins and background graphics enabled in your print settings.

You can change the text in the box at the top, and the cards should update in real time.  Each line will become a card.  You can use HTML for formatting (e.g., `<br />`, `<strong>`, `<em>`).  The text box will not show up when printing (in modern browsers), only the cards.  Edit `/conversation_starter_cards/index.html` if you want to change the default card list.
