## Speed Friending Conversation Starter Cards

Navigate to `/conversation_starter_cards/index.html`, and you should just be able to hit print.  You do need to have the Museo Sans font installed (grab it from the Anime Boston Brand Assets folder if you do not).

Make sure you print with zero margins and background graphics enabled in your print settings.

Edit `/conversation_starter_cards/edit_this_to_change_the_cards.js` to change the card text.  Each line will become a card.  You can use HTML for formatting (e.g., `<br />`, `<strong>`, `<em>`).
