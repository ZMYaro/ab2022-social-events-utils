## Anime Tropes Bingo Board Generator

Navigate to `/trope_bingo_boards/index.html`, and you should just be able to hit print (or increase the number of boards and then hit print).  You do need to have the Museo Sans font installed (grab it from the Anime Boston 2022 Brand Assets shared drive folder if you do not).

Make sure you print with zero margins and background graphics enabled in your print settings.  The input fields will not show up when printing (in modern browsers), only the bingo pages.

You can change the number of boards generated or the list of tropes they are generated from in the fields at the top, and the boards should update in real time (it may lag if you ask it to generate several hundred boards).  Each line will become one possible bingo board square.  Review how they all look on the cards to see whether you need any manual line breaks to make them format nicely.  You can use HTML for formatting (e.g., `<br />`, `<em>`).  Edit `/trope_bingo_boards/index.html` if you want to change the default trope list.

The boards will be randomized every time they are generated, so there is no guarantee how many duplicates may exist between two separately generated sets.

An already-generated, ready-to-print PDF of 400 boards is in the Anime Boston 2022 Social Programming shared drive folder.

## Speed Friending Conversation Starter Cards

Navigate to `/conversation_starter_cards/index.html`, and you should just be able to hit print.  You do need to have the Museo Sans font installed (grab it from the Anime Boston 2022 Brand Assets shared drive folder if you do not).

Make sure you print with zero margins and background graphics enabled in your print settings.  The text box will not show up when printing (in modern browsers), only the cards.

You can change the text in the box at the top, and the cards should update in real time.  Each line will become a card.  Review how they all look on the cards to see whether you need to add manual line breaks to make them format nicely.  You can use HTML for formatting (e.g., `<br />`, `<strong>`, `<em>`).  Edit `/conversation_starter_cards/index.html` if you want to change the default card list.
